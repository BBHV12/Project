                    <strong>1. Data:</strong> Data refers to raw facts and figures that are contextually relevant. In the context of a database, data can encompass a wide range of types, including numbers, text, dates, images, and more. Data forms the building blocks of information and is fundamental to any database system. For instance, in an online shopping database, data might include product names, prices, descriptions, and customer details.

                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>2. Information:</strong> Information is processed data that has context, relevance, and purpose. It is the result of organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights. In the context of databases, information provides actionable knowledge that supports decision-making processes. For example, in a sales database, information could include quarterly revenue reports, customer buying patterns, and sales forecasts based on historical data.

                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>3. Metadata:</strong> Metadata refers to data that describes other data. It provides information about the characteristics of data, such as its structure, format, location, and relationships with other data elements. Metadata is crucial for understanding and managing data assets within a database system. In practice, metadata can include database schema information, data definitions, data lineage, and data governance policies.
        
                    <div class="center"><img src="https://www.ontotext.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Metadata_01-1024x512.png" alt="Metadata" width="200"><br><em>Fig 3: Metadata</em></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>4. Data Dictionary:</strong> A data dictionary is a centralized repository that stores metadata definitions and descriptions for all data elements used within a database. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the structure, semantics, and usage of data within an organization. A data dictionary typically includes information about data types, field lengths, valid values, and relationships between data elements. It aids in data management, data integration, and ensuring data consistency across different applications and systems.

                    <strong>5. Database:</strong> A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve data according to predefined schemas and relationships. Databases are essential components of information systems and support a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to complex data analysis and transaction processing. Examples include relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra), and cloud databases (like Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
        
                    <div class="center"><img src="https://blog.teamnexus.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/databases.png" alt="Database" width="200"><br><em>Fig 5: Database</em></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>6. Table:</strong> In database terminology, a table is a collection of related data organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute or field of the record. Tables are fundamental units of data storage in relational databases and provide a structured way to store and retrieve information. For example, in a customer database, a table named "Customers" might include columns such as customer ID, name, address, and phone number.
        
                    <div class="center"><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nadia-Anwar/publication/24412176/figure/fig4/AS:267610268893197@1440814668096/TCl-Db-Database-Tables-TCl-Db-tables-represent-the-database-implementation-PK-means.png" alt="Table" width="200"><br><em>Fig 6: Table</em></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>7. Tuple:</strong> A tuple is a single row of data within a table in a relational database. It represents a complete set of related data fields that define a specific entity or record. Tuples are structured according to the table's schema, where each field corresponds to a column in the table. For example, in an employee database table, a tuple might include fields such as employee ID, name, department, and salary.
        
                    <div class="center"><img src="https://odinuv.cz/slides/relational-database/relation.svg" alt="Tuple" width="200"><br><em>Fig 7: Tuple</em></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>8. Field:</strong> A field, also known as a column or attribute, is a single data element within a table. It represents a specific characteristic or property of an entity being modeled in the database. Fields are used to store different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and binary data. For example, in a product inventory database table, fields might include product ID, product name, price, and quantity in stock.

                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>9. Domain:</strong> In database terms, a domain specifies the allowable values that can be entered into a particular column of a table. It defines the set of possible values for a data attribute and ensures data integrity by restricting the type and format of data that can be stored. For example, a domain for a "Gender" column might restrict values to "Male," "Female," or "Other" to maintain consistency and validity of data entries.
        
                    <div class="center"><img src="https://www.boardinfinity.com/blog/content/images/2023/05/Domain-Constraint-DBMS-1.png" alt="Domain" width="200"><br><em>Fig 9: Domain</em></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
        
                    <strong>10. Constraint:</strong> A constraint is a rule or condition that enforces data integrity and accuracy within a database. Constraints define the limits or conditions for the data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted in a database table. Common types of constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints. They help maintain data quality, enforce business rules, and prevent inconsistencies or errors in data operations.

                    <strong>11. Key:</strong> In database design, a key is a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies a record in a table. Keys are essential for establishing relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity, and enabling efficient data retrieval operations. Common types of keys include primary keys, which uniquely identify each record in a table, and foreign keys, which establish relationships between tables by referencing primary keys from other tables.
