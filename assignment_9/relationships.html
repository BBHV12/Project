                <h1>TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS IN DBMS</h1>
                <hr>     
                <h2>ONE TO ONE (1:1) RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In a one-to-one relationship, a single record in one table is associated with a single record in another table. This type of relationship is often used when you want to split data into two tables but still maintain a direct link between them.</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Example: Each person has one unique passport.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Create two tables, `Person` and `Passport`, where the primary key of `Person` is also a foreign key in `Passport`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ONE TO MANY (1:M) RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In a one-to-many relationship, a single record in one table is associated with multiple records in another table. This is one of the most common types of relationships in databases.</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Example: A single customer can have multiple orders.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Create two tables, `Customer` and `Order`, where the primary key of `Customer` is a foreign key in `Order`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>MANY TO MANY (M:M) RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In a many-to-many relationship, multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table. This type of relationship is typically implemented using a junction table.</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Example: Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Create three tables, `Student`, `Course`, and a junction table `Enrollment` that contains foreign keys referencing both `Student` and `Course`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>MANY TO ONE (M:1) RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In a many-to-one relationship, multiple records in one table are associated with a single record in another table. This is essentially the reverse of a one-to-many relationship.</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Example: Multiple employees can work in a single department.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Create two tables, `Employee` and `Department`, where the primary key of `Department` is a foreign key in `Employee`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>SELF REFERENCING (1:1) RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In a self-referencing relationship, a table contains a relationship with itself. This is used to model hierarchical data or recursive relationships.</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Example: An employee can be a manager of other employees.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Create a single table `Employee` with a foreign key that references the primary key of the same table to indicate the manager-employee relationship.</li>
</ol>
